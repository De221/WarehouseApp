# WarehouseApp
A beginner level Spring Boot REST API project for warehouse management, coordiantion between workers and task documentation. This is my first Spring project ever so it doesn't adhere to good practices.
The project consists of:

* plain HTML,JS,CSS frontend with "Home","Admin-home","User-home",
* JWT for communication between the backend and the frontend.
# Technologies used:
